# Changelog

All notable changes to the Galaxy Flow project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [v0.13.10] - 2026-04-07

### Changed
- **Self-update channel defaults**: `gx self check` and `gx self update` now default `--channel` to `stable`, matching the main-branch release channel without requiring the flag to be passed every time.
- **Self-check human output**: Reworked `gx self check` terminal output into a status report that highlights channel, current version, remote version, and semver relation, and suggests the update command when a newer version is available.

### Fixed
- **Remote project subdir init source**: Corrected `gx init project --path <subdir>` remote initialization so it copies the selected remote subdirectory contents into `./_gal/` instead of resolving against an intermediate cached checkout and ending up with mismatched template contents.
- **Init failure cleanup**: When remote project initialization fails after creating `./_gal/`, the command now removes the whole temporary target directory instead of only trying to delete an empty folder.

## [v0.13.9] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- **Init project subdir flattening**: `gx init project --path <subdir>` now places the selected template contents directly under `./_gal/` instead of leaving an extra nested directory such as `./_gal/rust/`.
- **Init target safety guard**: Added an internal boundary check so project init cleanup only reorganizes paths that were downloaded inside `./_gal/`, preventing accidental moves or deletions outside the init target.
- **CLI and shell test isolation**: Hardened loader, command, shell, and activity tests against shared working-directory pollution by pinning them to the workspace root and using stable absolute script/config paths where needed.
- **Module update config test isolation**: Reworked the `gx mod update` user-config regression test to run in a temporary project workspace so it no longer hits repository-local git extern modules or stalls on remote update paths.

## [v0.13.8] - 2026-04-06

### Changed
- **Repository ownership alignment**: Updated project, release, manifest, and installer endpoints from the legacy `galaxy-sec` organization to `galaxio-labs`.
- **Init project defaults**: Updated `gx init project` default template repository and related CLI help text to use `https://github.com/galaxio-labs/prj-tpl.git`.
- **Self-update sources**: Switched self-update manifest and install script defaults to the new `galaxio-labs` repository paths.

### Documentation
- **README and guides**: Refreshed README, CLI guide, syntax notes, self-update design docs, and updates documentation to match the current repository ownership and release endpoints.
- **Release metadata**: Synchronized version metadata and manifest template references for `0.13.8`.

### Fixed
- **Examples and tests**: Updated embedded example, template, and test repository URLs so init flows, parser examples, and template loading no longer point at retired `galaxy-sec` paths.

## [v0.13.5] - 2026-03-23

### Changed
- **Init project CLI redesign**: Replaced `--tpl` with separate `--repo` and `--path` options.
  - `gx init project` → local init (offline, creates basic work.gxl and adm.gxl)
  - `gx init project --path rust` → remote init from default repo's subdir
  - `gx init project --repo <url>` → remote init from custom repo
- **Default repo**: `https://github.com/galaxio-labs/prj-tpl.git` is used when `--path` is specified without `--repo`.
- **Parameter validation**: `--branch` and `--tag` now require `--repo` or `--path`.

### Fixed
- **Directory cleanup**: If copy to `_gal` fails, the empty directory is now cleaned up.

## [v0.13.4] - 2026-03-15

### Changed
- **Command success semantics**: Renamed the shell option field used by `gx.cmd`, `gx.shell`, and `gx.read_cmd` from `expect` to `ok_codes`, making it explicit that it represents the allowlist of successful exit codes.
- **Action result model**: Switched command action results to structured `exit_code`, `stdout`, and `stderr` fields instead of merging stdout/stderr into a single output field.
- **Module update result reporting**: `gx mod update` now summarizes git extern modules per config file and emits a final project-level update summary.

### Fixed
- **Module update config collection**: When both `./_gal/work.gxl` and `./_gal/adm.gxl` exist, `gx mod update` now keeps both inputs instead of dropping an existing config.
- **CLI output contract**: Human-oriented `gx mod update` result summaries now go to `stderr`, keeping `stdout` free of explanatory text.
- **Parser and regression coverage**: Added `ok_codes` parsing coverage and execution assertions for `exit_code/stdout/stderr` command results.

## [v0.13.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- **Unified `gx` CLI**: Added `gx` as the sole shipped command entrypoint, covering `run`, `adm`, `init`, `mod`, `doc`, `check`, and `self`.
- **Compact aliases**: Added `grun` -> `gx run` and `gadm` -> `gx adm` alias-based entry support.
- **CLI doc renderer**: Added `gx doc` topic indexing and terminal-friendly markdown rendering with `--markdown` raw output support.

### Changed
- **Project init assets**: Moved local init templates from `app/gprj/init` to `app/gx/init`.
- **Release packaging**: Release workflow, installer, and self-update now package and verify only the `gx` binary.
- **Workspace docs**: Updated README and guide docs to present `gx` as the default and only binary entrypoint.
- **CLI command model**: Renamed module management to `gx mod update`, split `gx run` and `gx adm` into dedicated clap wrappers with independent help text, and clarified `project`-oriented wording across the CLI.
- **CLI runtime setup**: Unified `gx init project` with the same runtime initialization path used by other commands, including log setup and `~/.galaxy/conf.toml` loading.

### Removed
- **Legacy binaries**: Removed shipped `gflow` and `gprj` binaries from the workspace and release artifacts.
- **Legacy CLI docs**: Removed dedicated `gflow` and `gprj` usage pages from the guide.
- **Legacy gx compatibility surface**: Removed deprecated `gx conf`, `gx init prj`, `gx init prj-with-local`, `gx update mod`, `--mod_up`, `--conf-work`, `--conf-adm`, and other obsolete compatibility flags.

### Fixed
- **Local workspace bootstrap**: Changed the repository `_gal/work.gxl` extern path to use `./_gal/` instead of `${GXL_START_ROOT}`, avoiding parse failures when `GXL_START_ROOT` is unavailable.
- **Module update semantics**: `gx mod update` now loads `~/.galaxy/conf.toml` consistently and fails fast when neither `./_gal/work.gxl` nor `./_gal/adm.gxl` exists.
- **CLI exit behavior**: `gx adm` now returns non-zero when all flows fail, while `gx run` / `gx adm` without an explicit flow keep the menu behavior and return success.
- **Output contract**: Tightened `gx` stdout/stderr behavior so markdown doc output stays machine-clean, explanatory CLI messages move to `stderr`, and quiet mode suppresses executor/menu chatter instead of leaking it to `stdout`.
- **Init command validation**: `gx init project` now treats `--branch` and `--tag` as mutually exclusive and routes human-oriented init messages to `stderr`.
- **Galaxy environment bootstrap**: `gx init env` now also creates the default global `~/.galaxy/conf.toml` when missing.

## [v0.12.4] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- **Self-update command set**: Added `gx self status/check/update/rollback/auto` for upgrade management.
- **Self-update runtime module**: Added `src/self_update/*` covering policy/state storage, manifest download, checksum verification, install/rollback, and health check.
- **Repository manifests**: Added `updates/stable/manifest.json`, `updates/alpha/manifest.json`, `updates/beta/manifest.json`, and `updates/README.md`.

### Changed
- **Release channels**: Unified channels to `stable|alpha|beta` (removed `pre` compatibility mode).
- **Default manifest source**: `manifest_base_url` now points to this repository raw path under `updates/`.
- **Version automation**: Switched project version bump flow to `gx.patch_file` marker-based patching in `_gal/adm.gxl`.

### Fixed
- **Update semantics**: `--dry-run` no longer requires `--yes`.
- **State persistence**: Expanded failure-state recording for post-manifest update stages.
- **Lock safety**: Added stale-lock recovery with PID liveness checks.
- **Rollback robustness**: Hardened backup id validation and prevented path traversal via `rollback --id`.
- **Installer safety**: Enforced unique binary detection and ignored symlink hits in package scanning.
- **Temp artifacts**: Added automatic cleanup of self-update temporary directories.
